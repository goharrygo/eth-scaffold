Starscream is a conforming WebSocket ([RFC 6455](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)) client library in Swift.

Its Objective-C counterpart can be found here: [Jetfire](https://github.com/acmacalister/jetfire)

## Features

- Conforms to all of the base [Autobahn test suite](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite/).
- Nonblocking. Everything happens in the background, thanks to GCD.
- TLS/WSS support.
- Compression Extensions support ([RFC 7692](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692))
- Simple concise codebase at just a few hundred LOC.

## Example

First thing is to import the framework. See the Installation instructions on how to add the framework to your project.

```swift
import Starscream
```

Once imported, you can open a connection to your WebSocket server. Note that `socket` is probably best as a property, so it doesn't get deallocated right after being setup.

```swift
socket = WebSocket(url: URL(string: "ws://localhost:8080/")!)
socket.delegate = self
socket.connect()
```

After you are connected, there are some delegate methods that we need to implement.

### websocketDidConnect

websocketDidConnect is called as soon as the client connects to the server.

```swift
func websocketDidConnect(socket: WebSocketClient) {
    print("websocket is con
