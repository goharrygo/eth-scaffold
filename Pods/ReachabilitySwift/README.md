# Reachability.swift

Reachability.swift is a replacement for Apple's Reachability sample, re-written in Swift with closures.

It is compatible with **iOS** (8.0 - 11.0), **OSX** (10.9 - 10.13) and **tvOS** (9.0 - 11.0)

## Supporting **Reachability.swift**
Keeping **Reachability.swift** up-to-date is a time consuming task. Making updates, reviewing pull requests, responding to issues and answering emails all take time. If you'd like to help keep me motivated, please download my free app, [Photo Flipper] from the App Store. (To really motivate me, pay $1.99 for the IAP ðŸ˜€)

And don't forget to **â˜…** the repo. This increases its visibility and encourages others to contribute.

Thanks
